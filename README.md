A simple Spring Boot command line application to test JDBC connection to Postgresql database.

[![Maven Build Status](https://github.com/aimtiaz11/postgresql-jdbc-tester/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aimtiaz11/postgresql-jdbc-tester/actions/workflows/maven.yml)


## How to run

Download the JAR from [release](https://github.com/aimtiaz11/postgresql-jdbc-tester/releases/tag/v1.0.0) page or alternatively checkout the code from this repository and run:

```
mvn clean package
```

Execute the JAR file. Example below:

```
java -jar target/postgresql-jdbc-tester-1.0.jar "db_user" "db_pass" "jdbc:postgresql://mydb.postgres.database.azure.com:1234/databaseName"
```

> *Security Tip*: A good practice is to read the JDBC string into a variable using the `read` command in Linux to prevent DB credentials in JDBC string to be logged in bash history.

## How it works

To test the JDBC connection, the app will attempt to connect to Postgresql database and execute a single SQL query: `SELECT 1` and close connection.
